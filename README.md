# Implementing Go Concurrency Code in Java20
Java implementation of Go Tour Concurrency Examples

Most of the go code is simply copied from [Official Go Tour Page](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1)
Only exercise codes are added.

Java implementations are based on **Java 20**.

## Approach

Java codes are tried to be as close as to the Go codes. When applicable similar features are used. When a similar feature is absent, it is tried to be devised using builtin java constructs.

## Virtual Threads

Virtual threads are only available for preview in Java 20. So it is required to enable preview while buiding and running the code files.
